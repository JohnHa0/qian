## Tl;dr


![A tiny gif](http://full.ouplo.com/11/2e/DVAQ.gif)


Since I'm on Mac, I mainly use the terminal to navigate my files because
I do not like much Finder (I don't really have any arguments ...).
So I decided to build a small file explorer (mainly to navigate my documents)
that would fit perfectly to **my needs**.

I used **Elm** because I wanted to learn how to use it, and **Electron**
because I want to prototype quickly.
