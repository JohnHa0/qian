## Tl;dr

Since I'm on Mac, I mainly use the terminal to navigate my files because
I do not like much Finder (I don't really have any arguments ...).
So I decided to build a small file explorer (mainly to navigate my documents)
that would fit perfectly to **my needs**.

I used **Elm** because I wanted to learn how to use it, and **Electron** because
I wanted to prototyping quickly.
